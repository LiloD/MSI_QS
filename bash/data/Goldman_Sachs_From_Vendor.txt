1)How to implement below scenario in Java?
        Consider we have a restaurant; we have to manage the persons who are coming to restaurant. 
	       • We have to greet the people and assign particular table to them
	       • How do we serve 20 tables as we are having only 4 waiters
2)How do we find a particular string in a large file? Tell me different scenarios.
3)How do maintain user insertion order of collection in java.
