First person
1. What’s the difference between facade and delegate?
2. What’s singleton? How to write?
3. What’s the difference between class level lock and object level lock?
4. Suppose you have an object, and this object has two synchronized methods. Can multiple threads get access to these two methods at the same time? 
5. What’s volatile key word?
6. Some questions about concurrent package.
7. What are the top three interfaces in collections package.
8. What’s the difference between hashmap, hashtable, and treemap?
9. Which one is the fastest? Why?
10. When we use the hashmap, what happens if two elements have the same hash code?
11. Suppose we have a piece of code, and we want to guarantee that multiple thread can read it at the same time, and only one thread can update it. What should we do?
12. In hibernate, how to manage transaction for two databases?

Second person
1. We have one object which has a read method and a write method. We want multiple threads can get access to the read method at the same time, and only one thread can get access to the write method at the same time. And when one thread get into the write method, the read method should be blocked.
2. How to do question 1 by using concurrent package.
3. Difference between interface and abstract class.
4. Suppose you need to design a real time system in java, what problem will you meet? How to deal with them.
