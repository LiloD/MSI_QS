Java: Not sure if the questions I heard are correct:
1. There have 2 interfaces “A” and “B”, a class “Sub” implements A, how to use the function in interface B within class Sub, but without implements interface B? 
2. One class, has a constructor, a static block, and a main() function. What is the implementation order of these 3 parts? Like each one has a System.out.println(). Which will be displayed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd? 
3. 2 strings, defined as following:
     a = “abc”;
     b = “abc”;
   How many objects exist and why? 
4. How to convert the datatype “date” from “java.sql” package to “java.util” package? From “java.sql.date” to” java.util.date”(answer seems should be “Calendor” class/package/api, not sure) The guy(Srinivas) who ask this question, if he say this word “Calendor”, it will be pronounced as “Gallon”. 
5. Similar as question 1, 2 interfaces A and B, how to use the methods in interface A within interface B without implement them? 

Flex: 
1. What is the property of “creationPolicy” of ViewStack? Does other components/label/other things have this property also? 
2. A label is in a HGroup, is there any differences between the following 2 properties statemens?
(1) Visible = “false”
(2) includeInLayout = “false”
3. What are the functions we need to override / implement for customize components? 
4. What event will be dispatched if we add or remove any element from an “arraycollection”?
   Or, another way to ask: is there any different between “Array” and “ArrayCollection” in flex?
   Or, 3rd way to ask: can we use an array for “dataProvider” in a “DataGrid”? Are array and arraycollection both can be used?
5.  What are the differences between AS Singleton and Java Singleton?
6. In AS, we define 
      public var x:Number = 0;
   If we use trace(x), 0 will be displayed. But if we just define a variable like: 
      public var y:Number;
   Then we use trace(y), what will be displayed? (Number type default value)
