1. What's your top skill set? 
2. What spring API I had been used?
3. A jsp form allows the user to input name and birthday. There has a simple format controller 	to receive the info and 
   send back to a Java file, is there may any error occur while in this process? (His tip: think about the Spring 
   lifecycle, and the controller) Like the information get from the front is always string, and the back end need integer. 
4. Same scenario as question 3, two functions in that Java file, 1st one is called handleRequest(), the other one is 
   called generatePassword(). One local variable called UserInfo, is there any 	problem while the SimpleFormatController 
   is sending some information back to the local variable UserInfo via function handleRequest()?   
   What if there is only 1 function (no generatePassword()), is the problem will still remain? 
5. Familiar with Maven? 
6. In database, 2 tables, User and Role.  Each user may have many roles, each role may have many users also. They are 
   many to many relationships. How to config them? Config Steps? What if we want to add a new property, like the date 
   when this user get this role, how to modify? (Table, config file, java beans everything)
7. What's mean of keyword "Transient"?
8. Explain the Serializable class. 
9. How to write Singleton in Java?  Explain each step. 
10. Can we use clone() in a Singleton? Any issue may occur? Any different between the cloned one and the original one? 
11. Can a class be protected? or private? why protected? why private? different? 
12. One interface called vehicle, two classes car and bus extend from this interface. A method 	called drive(), it require a parameter 
    like this:   
        drive( vehicle v ); 
    Two objects of each class: 
	Car c = new Car();
	Bus b = new Bus();
    Can c or b be used as the parameter in function drive()? 
    How to distinguish them in function drive()?
